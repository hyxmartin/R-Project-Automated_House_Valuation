# R-Project-Automated_House_Valuation 
A real estate agency considers offering an automated valuation service for prospective customers who consider selling their
homes. The current valuation method is based on historical prices of nearby properties, which are often
outdated and the process requires a substantial amount of work to manually adjust values. The agency
seeks improvements by using the available historical transaction data more creatively. They have provided reference data and
asked to construct a predictive model to estimate selling price using known characteristics of properties.

This mini project only has one code file.

Thanks,
Martin
